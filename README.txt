There are four programs included, which are "Knapsack-HC.cpp", "FormattedKnapsack-HC.cpp", "Knapsack-ID.cpp", and "FormattedKnapsack-ID.cpp". The programs with "Formatted" in their names include all the miscellaneous formatting outputs alongside the final output. On the other hand, programs without "Formatted" in their names have all the miscellaneous output statements commented out (/*Like this*/), and thus strictly print out only the final outputs of the knapsack problem. Functionality-wise, the program files with and without "Formatted" in their names are the same. To run the programs, simply put the input text file in the same directory as the program files and then compile the program files.
